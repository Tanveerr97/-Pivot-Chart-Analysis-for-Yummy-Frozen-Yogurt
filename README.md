# Summary of Your Pivot Chart Analysis for Yummy Frozen Yogurt
I have created a Pivot Table and Pivot Chart Analysis to study sales performance based on rainfall conditions (Heavy vs. Normal), categorized by month, year, and region.

Key Steps Taken:

* Data Preparation:

Classified rainfall as Heavy (â‰¥100mm) or Normal (<100mm) using Excel formulas or Power Query.
Extracted Month & Year from the date column for time-based analysis.

* Pivot Table Setup:

Rows: Month & Year.
Columns: Rainfall Condition (Heavy/Normal).
Filters: Region (to analyze specific areas).
Values: Average Sales.

* Pivot Chart & Visualization:

Used Clustered Column Chart, Line Chart, or Stacked Bar Chart for clear comparisons.
Added Slicers for Region, Month, and Year for dynamic filtering.

* Insights Gained:

Identified sales trends under different rainfall conditions.

Compared seasonal sales performance across multiple years and regions.

Highlighted which months or locations perform better in heavy or normal rainfall.

This analysis helps in strategic decision-making, ensuring better inventory planning and sales forecasting based on weather conditions.
